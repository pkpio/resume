\section{Experience}
    \begin{entrylist}
        \entry
            {2017-now}
            {Microsoft London, SwiftKey team}
            {Software Engineer}
            {\emph{Proposed and implemented a custom file format for SwiftKey Puppets that is 45x faster \& 4x smaller than the standard 3D format (FBX), and 800x faster \& 18x smaller than the existing format in use. Took full ownership in developing the file schema, a convertor to transform 3D assets from standard format, and a file loader to read data structures from the custom format.
            \newline
            \newline
            Primary contributor to the Puppets Android Rendering Engine built in C++ using OpenGL ES APIs. Implemented the Phong lighting model for Ambient and Directional lights. Rearchitectured the whole code to make it unit testable, integrated Google test framework and added over 70 unit tests. The engine is  capable of rendering over 200 FPS on very high end devices.
            \newline
            \newline
            Contributed to the App size reduction of SwiftKey. Implemented coachmarks \& banners to highlight the custom themes feature. Developed a new internal tool to test keyboard performance in rapid typing scenarios, capable of detecting regressions with precision of 2 ms. }}
        \entry
            {2014–2017}
            {Center for Advanced Security Research Darmstadt}
            {Research assistant}
            {\emph{Contributed to projects in Cloud security, Anonymous voice communications, and Analysis of attacks on Android. Co-authored 3 papers published in top tier conferences.}}
        \entry
            {05–08 2014}
            {Google Summer of Code}
            {Android Developer \& Linux Kernel Programmer}
            {\emph{Developed kernel display drivers for accessing the GUI of a Linux device on Android over USB interface. Improved the frame rate from an initial 10fps to 25fps by employing partial updates for only modified areas of UI and by implementing Run-length Encoding for loss-less, inline compression of image updates.}}
